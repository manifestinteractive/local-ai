# Alternative to the top_p, and aims to ensure a balance of quality and variety.
# The parameter p represents the minimum probability for a token to be considered, relative to the probability of the most likely token.
# For example, with p=0.05 and the most likely token having a probability of 0.9, logits with a value less than 0.045 are filtered out. 
# Default: 0.0
PARAMETER min_p 0.0

# Enable Mirostat sampling for controlling perplexity.
# default: 0, 0 = disabled, 1 = Mirostat, 2 = Mirostat 2.0
PARAMETER mirostat 0

# Influences how quickly the algorithm responds to feedback from the generated text.
# A lower learning rate will result in slower adjustments, while a higher learning rate will make the algorithm more responsive.
# Default: 0.1
PARAMETER mirostat_eta 0.1

# Controls the balance between coherence and diversity of the output.
# A lower value will result in more focused and coherent text.
# Default: 5.0
PARAMETER mirostat_tau 5.0

# Sets the size of the context window used to generate the next token.
# Default: 2048	
PARAMETER num_ctx 4096

# Maximum number of tokens to predict when generating text.
# Default: -1, infinite generation
PARAMETER num_predict -1

# Sets how far back for the model to look back to prevent repetition.
# Default: 64, 0 = disabled, -1 = num_ctx
PARAMETER repeat_last_n 64

# Sets how strongly to penalize repetitions.
# A higher value (e.g., 1.5) will penalize repetitions more strongly, while a lower value (e.g., 0.9) will be more lenient.
# Default: 1.1
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.1

# Sets the random number seed to use for generation.
# Setting this to a specific number will make the model generate the same text for the same prompt.
# Default: 0
PARAMETER seed 0

# Sets the stop sequences to use.
# When this pattern is encountered the LLM will stop generating text and return.
# Multiple stop patterns may be set by specifying multiple separate stop parameters in a modelfile.
PARAMETER stop "AI assistant:"

# The temperature of the model.
# Increasing the temperature will make the model answer more creatively.
# Default: 0.8
PARAMETER temperature 0.8

# Tail free sampling is used to reduce the impact of less probable tokens from the output.
# A higher value (e.g., 2.0) will reduce the impact more, while a value of 1.0 disables this setting.
# Default: 1
# PARAMETER tfs_z 1

# Reduces the probability of generating nonsense.
# A higher value (e.g. 100) will give more diverse answers, while a lower value (e.g. 10) will be more conservative.
# Default: 40
PARAMETER top_k 40

# Works together with top-k.
# A higher value (e.g., 0.95) will lead to more diverse text, while a lower value (e.g., 0.5) will generate more focused and conservative text. 
# Default: 0.9
PARAMETER top_p 0.9
